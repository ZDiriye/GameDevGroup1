Eafys Tower

# About This Game

In this tower defense game, players must strategically place towers to stop enemies from reaching the end of a path.

Enemies move along a set route, and it's up to you to destroy them before they cross the finish line. 

Set up your towers quickly and plan carefully to survive the first wave by stopping a group of enemies within a set period of time.

If any enemies make it through, you lose!
